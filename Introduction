Hello everyone! My name is Kassidy Buse, and I am a first year PhD student studying ruminant nutrition with a focus on dairy cattle. In terms of research, my interests are in assessing reduced-lignin alfalfa's influence on energy partitioning in lactating dairy cattle as well as comparing and modifying lab assays to determine rumen undegraded protein digestibility. Outside of grad school, I enjoy getting involved in any aspect of dairy I can, whether that be attending or showing in cattle shows or freelance writing for a couple ag magazines. I also enjoy photography - which I have also turned into a little side hustle - as well as baking and cooking. 
While I consider myself to be decent with computers, the programs (with the exception of SAS) we are exploring in this class are entirely new to me. I've had interest in learning R for a while now, so I'm definitely looking forward to exploring that software more. Also, I'm not going to lie and say I'm not intimidated by all the information that has been thrown at me thus far, but I'm ready for the challenge!
